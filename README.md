# DT Knowledge base

A self-hosted, single-user knowledge base where every page is stored as raw Markdown. Built for sysadmins and developers who want a fast, private place to keep code snippets, tech notes, and learning journals — with no database overhead beyond a single SQLite file.

Inspired by docmost and One Markdown

## Features

- **Spaces** — top-level containers to organise pages by topic or project
- **Nested pages** — tree structure with unlimited depth, drag-free re-parenting
- **Dual view per page** — Read mode (rendered HTML with syntax highlighting) and Edit mode (CodeMirror raw Markdown editor)
- **Auto-save** — edits are saved 800 ms after you stop typing
- **Full-text search** — SQLite FTS5 with snippet extraction, triggered with `Ctrl/Cmd+K`
- **GFM + emoji** — GitHub Flavored Markdown, `:smile:` syntax, and emoticon shortcodes
- **Syntax highlighting** — Atom One Dark theme via `rehype-highlight`
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Ctrl/Cmd+E` toggles Edit/Read mode, `Ctrl/Cmd+K` opens search
- **Login-protected** — single credential set in `.env`, no users table, session cookies via `iron-session`
- **Password change** — change your password from the settings page without restarting the server
- **Dark mode** — hardcoded, no toggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kb-markdown.git
cd kb-markdown
npm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a password hash and a session secret:

```sh
npm run setup -- --username admin --password yourpassword
```

Paste the printed values into `.env`. Your `.env` should look like:

```env
KB_USERNAME=admin
KB_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$12$...
SESSION_SECRET=<32-char random string>
PORT=3333
DB_PATH=./data/kb.db
NODE_ENV=development
```

`SESSION_SECRET` must be exactly 32 characters. Generate one independently with:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 24 | cut -c1-32
```

### Run migrations and start

```sh
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:3333` and the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Production Deployment

Build the app (Vite output is bundled into the server package):

```sh
npm run build
npm run db:migrate
npm start           # serves everything on the configured PORT
```

### systemd

```ini
[Unit]
Description=kb-markdown
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/kb-markdown
EnvironmentFile=/opt/kb-markdown/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server/dist/index.js
Restart=on-failure
User=kb

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Reverse proxy (nginx)

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3333;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
}
```

`X-Forwarded-For` is used by the login rate limiter (5 attempts / 60 s per IP), so set it when running behind a proxy.

## Data

All data lives in a single SQLite file (`data/kb.db` by default, controlled by `DB_PATH`). Back this file up — it is the only stateful component of the application.

Markdown source is stored in `pages.content`; rendered HTML is cached in `pages.content_html` and regenerated on every save. Deleting a page re-parents its children to the deleted page's parent rather than cascading.
